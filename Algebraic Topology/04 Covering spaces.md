Covering maps.
- $U \subseteq X$ is evenly covered by $p \colon \hat X \to X$ if $p^{-1}(U) \simeq \coprod_{\alpha \in A} U_\alpha$ and $p|_{U_\alpha}$ is a homeomorphism for all $\alpha$.
- $p \colon \hat X \to X$ is called a covering map if every point has an open neighbourhood that is evenly covered by $p$. If such a covering map exists, $\hat X$ is called a covering space of $X$.
- If $A$ is a space with the discrete topology, $A \times X$ is a covering space of $X$.
- Define $\mathbb R\mathbb P^n = S^n/\sim$ where $\sim$ is generated by $x \sim -x$. Then the quotient map $p \colon S^n \to \mathbb R\mathbb P^n$ is a covering map.

A lift of $f \colon Z \to X$ is $\hat f \colon Z \to \hat X$ where $p \circ \hat f = f$.
- **Lebesgue covering lemma**. Let $X$ be a compact metric space and $\{U_\alpha \mid \alpha \in A\}$ an open cover. Then there exists $\delta > 0$ such that every open ball $B_\delta(x)$ is contained in one of the $U_\alpha$.
- Let $\gamma \colon [a,b] \to X$ have $\gamma(a) = x_0$, and let $\mathrm{Im}\,\gamma$ lie in an open evenly covered set. Then $\gamma$ has the unique lifting property.
- If a path has the unique lifting property on two intersecting intervals, it has the unique lifting property on their union.
- Thus, any path has the unique lifting property by the Lebesgue covering lemma.
- Any homotopy $H \colon I \times I \to X$ has the lifting property at $(0,0)$ by applying the Lebesgue covering lemma and inductively extending the unique lift to small square patches.
- Uniqueness of homotopy lifting follows from uniqueness of path lifting.
- Let $\gamma_0, \gamma_1 \in \Omega(X,x_0,x_1)$ and $\gamma_0 \sim_e \gamma_1$. Then $\hat\gamma_0 \sim_e \hat\gamma_1$ as long as we lift $x_0$ to the same point in $\hat X$.
- Hence $\hat\gamma_0(1) = \hat\gamma_1(1)$. Define $\varepsilon_p \colon \pi(X,x_0) \to p^{-1}(x_0)$ by $\varepsilon_p[\gamma] = \hat\gamma(1)$ for a particular choice of $\hat x_0$.

A covering map is a universal cover if $\hat X$ is simply connected.
- If $p$ is a universal cover, $\varepsilon_p \colon \pi_1(X,x_0) \to p^{-1}(x_0)$ is a bijection of sets, as it is injective and surjective.
- $\varepsilon_p \colon \pi_1(S^1, 1) \to \mathbb Z$ is an isomorphism of groups under the covering map $x \mapsto e^{2\pi i x}$.
- $S^1$ is not contractible, otherwise it would be simply connected.
- Let $z \in S^1$ and $u,v \in \Omega(S^1,z,1)$. Then $u_\sharp, v_\sharp \colon \pi_1(S^1, z) \to \pi_1(S^1,1)$ are equal as $\mathbb Z$ is abelian.
- Suppose $f \colon S^1 \to S^1$ maps $f(1) = z$. Let $u \in \Omega(S^1, z,1)$, so $f_\star \colon \pi_1(S^1, 1) \to \pi_1(S^1, z)$ gives $u_\sharp \circ f_\star \colon \pi_1(S^1, 1) \to \pi_1(S^1, 1)$, a homomorphism $\mathbb Z \to \mathbb Z$, uniquely determined by its action on 1. The degree of $f$ is $(u_\sharp \circ f_\star)(1)$.
- Let $f_n(z) = z^n$. Then $\deg f_n = n$.
- (check through proof) $g_0, g_1 \colon S^1 \to S^1$ are homotopic iff they have the same degree.
- $g \colon S^1 \to S^1$ extends to $D^2$ iff its degree is zero.
