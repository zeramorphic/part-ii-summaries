Lattices.
- A subset of $\mathbb R^n$ is called discrete if its intersection with compact sets is finite.
- $\Lambda \subseteq \mathbb R^n$ is a discrete subgroup of $\mathbb R^n$ iff it is of the form $\oplus_{i=1}^m \mathbb Z x_i$ for $\mathbb R$-linearly independent $x_i$.
- A lattice is a discrete subgroup of $\mathbb R^n$ of rank $n$.
- The fundamental parallelogram of a lattice is given by its basis vectors.
- If $A$ maps the standard basis vectors to a basis of $\Lambda$, $\operatorname{covol}\Lambda = |\det A|$.

> [!theorem]
> **Minkowski's lemma**. Let $P$ be a fundamental parallelogram for $\Lambda$, and let $S$ be measurable.
> - If $\operatorname{vol}S > \operatorname{covol}\Lambda$. there are distinct points in $S$ with difference in $\Lambda$.
> - If $S$ is convex and symmetric around zero, then if either
> 		- $\operatorname{vol} S > 2^n \operatorname{covol}\Lambda$; or
> 		- $\operatorname{vol} S \geq 2^n \operatorname{covol}\Lambda$ and $S$ is closed, then
> there exists a nonzero point in $S \cap \Lambda$.

- $\sigma = (\sigma_1, \dots, \sigma_r, \Re \sigma_{r+1}, \Im \sigma_{r+1}, \dots, \Re \sigma_{r+s}, \Im \sigma_{r+s})$.
- $\sigma(\mathcal O_L)$ is a lattice in $\mathbb R^n$ of covolume $2^{-s} \sqrt{|D_L|}$.
- $\sigma(\mathfrak a)$ is a lattice in $\mathbb R^n$ of covolume $2^{-s} \sqrt{|D_L|} N(\mathfrak a)$.

> [!theorem]
> **Minkowski bound**. There exists $\alpha \in \mathfrak a$ with $\alpha \neq 0$ and $|N(\alpha)| \leq c_L N(\mathfrak a)$ where $C_L = \left(\frac 4\pi\right)^s \frac{n!}{n^n} \sqrt{|D_L|}$.

- Each element of the class group is represented by an ideal with norm at most $C_L$.
- The class group is finite, and generated by prime ideals with norm at most $C_L$.
